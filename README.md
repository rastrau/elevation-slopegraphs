# elevation-slopegraphs

## Scripts
Run `us-elevation-plots.R`, `europe-elevation-plots.R`, and `switzerland-elevation-plots.R` in R in order to produce a slopegraph of minimum and maximum (and for the US and Switzerland: mean) elevation per state or country in the US, in Europe, and in Switzerland, respectively.

## Visualizations

The code for the US and Switzerland also produces two (unrefined) alternatives / earlier iterations which you could use as starting points for your own experiments if you like:
